#a. Create an object that stores the value 3^2 * 4^1/8

a <- 3^2 * 4^(1/8)

#b. Overwrite your object in (a) by itself divided by 2.33.
# Print the result to the console.

a <- a / 2.33
print(a)


#c. Create a new object with the value (-8.2) * 10^(-13).

b <- (-8.2) * 10^(-13)

#d. Print directly to the console the result of multiplying (b) by (c).
